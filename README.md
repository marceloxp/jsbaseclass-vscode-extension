## **Example**

### **Input**
- Class Name: `App`

### **Generated Code**
```javascript
class JsBaseApp extends JsBaseClass {
    async handle() {
        // Your initialization code here
    }

    async onDomContentLoaded() {
        // On DOM content loaded (page load)
    }
}

window.jsBaseApp = new JsBaseApp();
window.jsBaseApp.init();
```

## **Template Details**

The generated template includes:

- **Class Definition**: A class extending `JsBaseClass` with a dynamic name.
- **`handle` Method**: For initialization code that runs immediately.
- **`onDomContentLoaded` Method**: For code that depends on the DOM being fully loaded.
- **Instance Initialization**: Automatically creates and initializes an instance of the class.
